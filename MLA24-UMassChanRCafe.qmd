## What is R Café?

- Group of R users at UMass Chan Medical School who meet monthly (online or in-person) to share R skills we've learned, cool R projects, troubleshoot code, and ask questions
- Started June 2022
- 16 gatherings so far (attendance ranging from 31-6, median of 9 people)

## How did the partnership come about?
- Ben, new faculty member, came for a tour of the library and was told that he should meet Tess, who was not there that day
- Set up a meeting. Discovered that we had a joint interest in promoting and supporting R coding on campus.
  - Ben and Tess both have experience teaching R and interest in supporting research reproducibility 

## Ben, what were you looking for from the library?
- Looking for stability and structure of the library 
  - Library has existing connections and broader view (outside department)
- Interested in institutional and data repositories
- Interested in NIH requirements for grants
- Library knowledge of electronic resources and administering access
- Centralized physical location

## Ben, what did the library bring to the partnership?
- Tess knew the resources, workflow, marketing channels, and how to coordinate events
- Administered DataCamp access
- Teaching experience (recording, running Zoom, video editing)
- Existing Github repository
- Created centralized virtual location for all materials

## What worked well?
- Blending of expertise:
  - Ben has a lot of experience in R, particularly applying it to medical research
  - Tess has a lot of experience in program planning at UMass Chan
- Website: Making materials available
- Hosting gatherings monthly and advertising each one

## What takeaways would you share from the collaboration?
- Good communication is key with regular check-ins before the after each gathering
- Centralized materials and outputs
- Being flexible: 
  - In-person --> Online
  - Quarterly --> Monthly
  - Giving time for people to do their own coding --> All demo and questions

## Tess, what are your tips for partnering with the research community?
- Find out what form of communication works best for the researcher(s)
- Administrators are your friends
- Plan for meetings in advance

## Ben, what advice would you give librarians for working with researchers?
- Communication
  - Be proactive in anticipating needs
  - Brief communications preferable to long meetings
- Provide structure
  - Centralized resources
  - Follow-up
  - Regular meeting times
- Find common interest
  - Passion for training students and trainees
  - Innovation and creativity

## Ben, what would you tell your colleagues about working with the library?
- We're so lucky to have a wonderful library with wonderful librarians
- Colleagues tend to under-utilize and don't realize the resources the library has
- As researchers, we must constantly deal with issues of data sharing and research: Useful to have librarians that are up to date on these policies

## Other collaborations that arose from this project:
- NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy Support
- All of Us Research
- Providing more support for R
- Data Science rotation for the Clinical Informatics Fellowship
- U-Match website for listing avilable research projects for students at UMass Chan
