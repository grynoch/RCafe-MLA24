## What worked well?

-   Blending of expertise:
    -   Ben has a lot of experience in R, particularly applying it to medical research
    -   Tess has a lot of experience in program planning at UMass Chan
-   Website: Making materials available
-   Hosting gatherings monthly and advertising each one

## What takeaways would you share from the collaboration?

-   Good communication is key with regular check-ins before the after each gathering
-   Centralized materials and outputs
-   Being flexible:
    -   In-person --\> Online
    -   Quarterly --\> Monthly
    -   Giving time for people to do their own coding --\> All demo and questions

## Tess, what are your tips for partnering with the research community?

-   Find out what form of communication works best for the researcher(s)
-   Administrators are your friends
-   Plan for meetings in advance

## Ben, what advice would you give librarians for working with researchers?

-   Communication
    -   Be proactive in anticipating needs
    -   Brief communications preferable to long meetings
-   Provide structure
    -   Centralized resources
    -   Follow-up
    -   Regular meeting times
-   Find common interest
    -   Passion for training students and trainees
    -   Innovation and creativity

## Ben, what would you tell your colleagues about working with the library?

-   We're so lucky to have a wonderful library with wonderful librarians
-   Colleagues tend to under-utilize and don't realize the resources the library has
-   As researchers, we must constantly deal with issues of data sharing and research: Useful to have librarians that are up to date on these policies

## Other collaborations that arose from this project:

-   NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy Support
-   All of Us Research
-   Providing more support for R
-   Data Science rotation for the Clinical Informatics Fellowship
-   U-Match website for listing available research projects for students at UMass Chan
